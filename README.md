# ClassificationModel-InVehicleCoupon

* The aim of this assignment is to build a simple classification model for the in-vehicle coupon recommendation data set from the UCI Machine Learning [repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/in-vehicle+coupon+recommendation).
* This is a simple dataset in which the objective of the model should be to determine whether a driver would accept a coupon based on a set of features including the type of coupon.

* This data studies whether a person will accept the coupon recommended to him in different driving scenarios. 
* This data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
* The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. For more information about the dataset, please refer to the paper:
